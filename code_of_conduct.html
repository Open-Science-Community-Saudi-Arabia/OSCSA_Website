                    <ul>
                        <li>Open Science/Scholarship Communities (OSCs) are bottom-up platforms by and for researchers
                            to exchange knowledge and

                                <li>Researchers are the target audience of OSCs, but students, researcher supporters,
                                    and others that are interested in
                                    (conducting) research are also welcome to join the community</li>
                                <li> No prior knowledge is required to be part of the community, nor are members in any
                                    way required to commit to certain
                                    open science/scholarship practices.</li>

                            OSCs organize, promote, and facilitate open science/scholarship events to (1) learn about
                            and discuss open
                            science/scholarship practices, (2) share open science/scholarship knowledge, and (3) build
                            professional networks.

                                <li>Events are open to both members and non-members, and are free-of-charge, if
                                    possible.</li>
                                <li>Attendees and organizers of events organized by OSCs should adhere to the Code of

                            refrain from being
                            normative or condescending, and do not tell others what to do. Respect for each others’

                    <hr>

                    <p>Open Science/Scholarship Communities (OSCs) organize, promote, and facilitate open science
                        events to enable all
                        participants, members and non-members, to learn about, share, and discuss open science
                        practices. The purpose of this
                        Code of Conduct (CoC) is to enable an environment in which diverse individuals can collaborate
                        and interact in mutual
                        respect. We recognize a shared responsibility to create and maintain that environment for the
                        benefit of all. Some
                        behaviors, therefore, are specifically prohibited:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Discriminating, racist, intimidating, harassing, lewd, demeaning, bullying, stalking, or
                            threatening speech oractions.</li>
                        <li>Any real or implied threat of physical harm</li>
                        <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
                        <li>Unwelcome physical contact</li>
                        <li>Sustained disruption of speakers or events (verbally or physically)</li>
                        <li>Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or other unacceptable behaviors
                        </li>
                        <li>Retaliation against an individual for participating in the investigation of a report of
                            harassment or otherunacceptable
                            behaviors</li>
                        <li>Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviors</li>
                        <li>Falsely reporting harassment or other unacceptable behaviors</li>

                    <p>
                        Critical examination of beliefs and view points does not, by itself, constitute hostile conduct
                        or harassment.
                        Similarly, use of sexual imagery or language in the context of a professional discussion might
                        not constitute hostile
                        conduct or harassment if necessary to the topic of discussion.

                        report it as soon as possible to (one of) the Coordinator(s) of the OSC organizing the event

                        the person you should
                        report to is the target of the complaint, you may contact the event organizers and/or the
                        confidential advisor(s) of
                        their employer. The target of the complaint will not be involved in handling or resolving the
                        incident. Every code of
                        conduct violation report will be treated with seriousness and care.

                        warning; (iii) expel the
                        offender(s) from the event (particularly if a participant's immediate safety is threatened);

                        offender(s) from the OSC. Community Coordinator(s) and event organizers will also discuss with
                        the complainant whether
                        they wish to contact the confidential advisor(s) at the affiliated University. The alleged
                        perpetrator(s) will be
                        notified of a complaint as soon as possible, and be given a chance to respond to the complaint.

                    <p><i>The above mentioned Guiding Principles and Code of Conduct apply to all OSCs that are part of
                            INOSC. Local OSCs that are
                            part of INOSC are not allowed to alter, adjust, or remove any of these sections, or
                            information
                            from them. Alocal
                            addendum to the Guiding Principles and/or the Code of Conduct is permitted, as long as none
                            of
                            the information specified
                            in the addendum contradicts the Guiding Principles and/or Code of Conduct as dictated above.
                            Anaddendum should be (1)
                            the final section of the document or webpage that contains the Guiding Principles and Code
                            of
                            Conduct, and (2) be
                            recognisable as such. That means the addendum should be placed under the header ‘Local
