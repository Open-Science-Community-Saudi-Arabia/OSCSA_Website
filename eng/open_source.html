              <p class="section-description"><b>Open / Free source software</b>So first, what is free and open-source software the term is a bit important because open-source software and free
              software are not necessarily the same things, free software doesn't mean open source. Many of us remember freeware on
              the internet from when we were younger this is software where we have no access to the source code and you can't work
              with it you can't modify it due to the license. This is not great for science.
              </p>
              <h1><b>Open / Free source software</b> </h1> 
               <p>
              on the other hand, open source doesn't mean free so for those of you who are producing research software just because
              you're making your software open source it doesn't mean it has to be free software. And the intersection of these two is
              often known as free and open-source software or FOSS free open-source software and this just refers to off software
              there's both open and free.</p>
              <p>
                 Open source is simply licensing your work so it can be used how you want. Making your software open source is just a
              matter of setting out the terms of how you want your software to be used it doesn't mean that you have to give up
              control of your software, it doesn't mean that you're putting it out to the community forever. It just means you're
              choosing and saying for yourself setting boundaries on how you want your software to be used.
              For those who want, you open source also makes it easy for others to remix your software to reuse it to build upon your
              software add new features if they want and if you're building a project where community is important where you want your
              software to be used by a lot of people making it open source in such a way that people can reuse and work with can be a
              really great boost for your software just in terms of visibility and people who want to use it things like that.
              So why use and promote open source?
              </p>
            <p>
               Open source is part of the ethics of um scientists and hackers a little bit when you're writing this software when
              you're working on projects together. A lot of the libraries you use, for Python things like this if you're using
              different programming languages a lot of py libraries you use will be open source. You're benefiting from a lot of work
              that other people have done so far, and it's a nice feeling to collaborate and give back now, you've built your software
              or your project on. Years and years of free work that was produced before, and now you're giving back to the community.
              It also means distributed innovation, so, when, you're making software open source and free so that other people can
              work on it, this means that other people will give back contributions they'll report bugs when they have issues running
              your software, they will tell you new features that they want. You don't have to implement them, but you're able to take
              all of these good ideas from the community and things like this. Importantly for science open source is easier to review
              reuse and integrate and.
            </p>
             <p>
               When we talk about open source and science, if you want your software to be distributed widely to be used in a lot of
              systems. One of the best things you can do for it is licensing it in such a way that everyone can use it and set it up
              on their own system things like galaxy
             </p>
             
              <h1><b>Risks of closed code </b></h1>
              there are a lot of risks associated with closed code to when you have closed source software used in science , you can’t
              review it very easily , the community cant review it easily , only the reviewer of the paper can sometimes and if there
              are errors/bugs in the software then can be missed for and years and years , And the this can affect the loss of science
              results downstream .so having your open source reviewable .it’s very important for reproducible ,good quality science, a
              lot of journals are adopting this and starting to require disclosure or publishing of your source code for all of your
              software ,this is from scientific perspective,its really a good thing for the community.
              
              <h1><b>How do know something is open source?</b></h1>
              <p>
                You will see a lot of GitHub repositories, which everyone is familiar with thanks to OLS is a little license on the
              right hand side of the rpositied, and also if you can see the CC by *****, you can look for a couple of different files
              within the license, and these files need to be there if it’s going to be an open source software that we can reuse. But
              it’s not just for software but also for data for thing like databases that want to make accessible for photo of training
              materials. all these are options. and if you want people to be able to use them you need to license it.
              </p> 
              
              <h1><b>Fears </b></h1>
              <p>
                 One of the common fears people have is that is they publish their software online someone will steal it, but isn’t
              necessarily true. if someone tries steal your software there is at least a traceable log in GitHub. there is a copy of
              your software already online and if you already have a community around that, it will be very obvious that someone took
              it and if you’re are still worried, they publish preprints as way to document that “hey, they were first to write the
              software” and to really make sure they stake your claim on the software, so don’t worry about just work in the open,
              it’s better for the community, it’s better for the world, and it’s good for science, publishing and sharing.
              </p>
             
              <h1><b>Version control </b></h1>
              <p>
                Sharing and publishing, one of the easiest and most effective ways to do, this is through version control. Version
              control is a fantastic way of share and publish code with others. it gives you whole timeline of the of your software
              and it make it easy to reuse, contribute and make modifications to your software
              
              </p>
              <h3>Why use version control</h3>
              <p>
                • It makes collaboration easy.
              • Reverts accidents
              • Merge changes from multiple developer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Examples of version control system
              The common ones are Git & Github.com, others are Bitbucket.org, Gitlab.com, Gitea.io.
              Where to learn?
              And if you want to learn about Git you can check out this website swcarpentry.Github.io/git-novice/ ,
              • Git is complex.
              • Start with the parts you need (commit, push, pull).
              • The rest comes later.
              </p>
              <h1><b>Few steps to make your work open source</b> </h1>
             
              <h3>Readme</h3>
              <p>
                It’s a very important part of this, if you want people know to what your software is and how to start using it. that the
              number one thing people will see .so be sure to include lots of good images there.
              </p> 
              <h3>License </h3>
              <p>
                If It is going to be open source it needs a license file, it only takes two minutes to add to GitHub, it’s really easy
              just doing same thing with the contributing Guide.
              </p>
              <h3>Contributing guide</h3>
              <p>
                GitHub has some template contributing guides that makes it really easy to tell people how you went them to contribute to
              your repositories.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Road map </h3>
             <p>
              Having a public road map is a great way to tell the community, what you’re working on, features you’re going to
              implement, things like that can help people get excited for your software.
             </p> 
              <h3>Issue </h3>
              <p>
                Publishing list of issues.it feels bad to say “hey, my software has bugs” but at least putting them out in the open. you
              can track the things you’ve done and not done, the bugs haven’t fixed.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Code of Conduct </h3>
              <p>The purpose of this Code of Conduct (CoC) is to enable an environment in which diverse individuals can collaborate and interact in mutual respect. We recognize a shared responsibility to create and maintain that environment for the benefit of all.</p>
              
              <h3>Contact</h3>
              <p>Can be useful in contacting in an event someone want to use your code or contribute</p>
              <h3>Citation</h3>
              <p>citation can be very useful as well .if you have Github repository you easily get those from Zenodo and Figshare</p>
              <h3>Contribute to open source</h3>
              <p>
                There are alot of ways you can contribute yourself if you are a first contributer.
                A good way to learn about working with Git and open source projects is to contributeto someone else's project yourself, and thereare alot of open scientific projectsout there.
